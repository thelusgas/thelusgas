# About me

_detailed portfolio coming soonâ„¢ at https://thelusgas.github.io/_

Hi! I'm Lucas, a fullstack web dev from deep into the entrails of sunny (scorching, really) Brazil.

As most web devs, I'm in a borderline abusive relationship with Javascript;
And keeping true to the stereotype, I'm specialized in React + Typescript.

Along my carreer I also messed with such things as SQL, C++, Node, .NET, AngularJS (yes, really), Angular (the real one), Svelte, Nestjs...

I'm always very enthusiastic about discovering and learning new things and finding ways to work them into my _ouvre_, lucky me there's a new JS framework coming out every other day.

I'm also huge into creating new things from scratch, optimizing, running into insane ideas that seem inconceivable at first and making them happen. I embrace the challenge; frustrating as it may be when things don't work out at first, eventually they will, and the reward is always great.
